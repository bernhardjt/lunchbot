# Lunchbot

TL;DR: lunch.markusziller.de

A python service that crawls and summarizes my lunch options at work (Unterf√∂hring, Germany). The service crawls various venues and trys to extract information about lunch menus from PDFs, Webpages and APIs.

- Provides an API and a static HTML page providing a simple Angular 1 UI
- Deployed on AWS Lambda with the serverless framework, check lunch.markusziller.de
- Has experimental support for Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services for OCR instead of tedious PDF parsing
